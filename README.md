# Hello-World
My initial GitHub repository for use with CSCI4830.

I am hoping to learn some things in the CSCI4830 class, but I am fearing the possibility of being asked to learn more than is possible for me to learn over the Summer. With a team of five people for the Project, there is a strong probability of a small pile of "favorite" tools for each of the participants. This is likely in addition to the tools we will be exposed to in the lesson plan itself.
